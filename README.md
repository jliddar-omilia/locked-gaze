Reading notes, following a presentation, or watching the person on screen can pull your gaze away from the camera. Locked Gaze helps bring it back, so you can focus on what you want to say.

*Illustrated product previews. The manga artwork is sample imagery, not a processed camera frame or an avatar feature.*

![Illustrated comparison: with correction off the character looks away; with correction on her gaze points toward the camera.](Resources/Screenshots/04-correction-off-on.png)

## Your conversation, your Mac

Your camera frames stay on your Mac. Eye-contact correction runs entirely on your device, without uploading video for processing. Locked Gaze does not record your camera feed.

![On-device, private, offline, and free: no hidden payments or subscriptions.](Resources/Screenshots/05-benefits-readme.png)

## A small app with a clear purpose

- **Eye contact, with less effort.** Gaze correction designed for conversations, presentations, and interviews.
- **A home in your menu bar.** Turn correction on when you need it and off when you are done.
- **One click from Control Center.** On macOS 26 or later, add the Locked Gaze control to turn correction on or off.
- **Your choice of camera.** Select a webcam or use your iPhone through Continuity Camera.
- **A camera you can select.** Choose **Locked Gaze** in video apps that support macOS virtual cameras.
- **Made for Apple Silicon.** Local processing built around your Mac.

## Three simple steps

After granting camera access and enabling the camera extension:

1. Keep **Automatic (System Preferred)** selected, or choose your source camera in Locked Gaze.
2. Click **Activate** in the menu bar.
3. Select **Locked Gaze** as the camera in your video app.

Click **Deactivate** whenever you want to stop processing.

## One click from Control Center

On **macOS 26 or later**, add the **Locked Gaze** control to Control Center. After the initial camera setup, click it whenever you want to turn eye-contact correction on or off. You can also keep using the menu-bar control.

## Download for Mac

Locked Gaze is available **free on the Mac App Store**. Download the ready-to-use app with everything needed for on-device gaze correction included.

[Download Locked Gaze on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6814174298)

[What's new in 1.0.1](CHANGELOG.md#101): more reliable virtual camera activation, better Control Center sync, and clearer default camera selection. The source version badge refers to this repository; the App Store page shows the version currently available to download.

[Follow Locked Gaze on GitHub](https://github.com/albond/locked-gaze) and give it a star to bookmark the project. The source edition includes the native application and model interface specifications. Model weights are not included; building a working gaze-correction app requires compatible models supplied separately.

Requires **macOS 14 Sonoma or later**, with **M2 Pro / Max / Ultra or a newer Pro / Max / Ultra chip**. Camera access and approval of the Locked Gaze camera extension are required.

## M5 source build

This fork allows the **base Apple M5** through the activation check, alongside
the existing M2-or-newer Pro / Max / Ultra chips. It does not change the App
Store release. Passing the hardware check does not establish gaze-correction
quality or real-time performance; those require testing with compatible models.

Build on Apple Silicon with Xcode (macOS 26 SDK or later), Python 3, and CMake:

```sh
python3 scripts/generate-project.py
bash scripts/test-source.sh
LOCKED_GAZE_SOURCE_ONLY=1 xcodebuild -project LockedGaze.xcodeproj \
  -scheme LockedGaze -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build/SourceOnly \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

That command creates an **unsigned, model-free verification build**, not a
working virtual camera. For a usable build, supply compatible models through
`LOCKED_GAZE_MODELS_PATH`, omit `LOCKED_GAZE_SOURCE_ONLY` and
`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`, and configure your own Apple signing team in the
ignored `Config/Signing.local.xcconfig`:

```xcconfig
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

The camera extension needs suitable Apple signing/provisioning, installation
at `/Applications/Locked Gaze.app`, camera permission, and extension approval
in macOS. See [model and signing requirements](Models/README.md#compiling-the-source-edition).
Keep model files and signing material local; they are not part of this fork.

Verified on a base Apple M5 with macOS 27 and Xcode 27: all 12 source test
suites passed, an unsigned Release build succeeded, and all four locally
installed models loaded and produced finite outputs with synthetic inputs.
Live camera operation and visual correction quality have not been verified;
the test machine had no Apple code-signing identity.
